/**
 * Caches instances of {@code byte[]} for re-use. <em>It is critically important that arrays are no longer used
 * or referenced after being passed to {@link #offerArray(byte[])}.</em>
 *
 * <p>With the <em>exception of zero-length-arrays</em> this acts equivalently to creating and discarding new arrays each-time.
 * Zero-length arrays may be deduped. This is safe provided you don't use it for locking or other
 * identity equality operations.</p>
 *
 * <p>The current implementation of this is a lock-free concurrent data-structure based on a number of instances of
 * {@link AtomicReferenceArray} (one per byte-array size), each of <em>prime</em> size
 * {@link #cacheSize} (currently 127).
 * These atomic-arrays each start empty.
 * The first time a thread attempts to access this cache a random {@code stepSize} and {@code location} are created and
 * stored in a {@link ThreadLocal}.</p>
 *
 * <p>When an array is requested with {@link #getArray(int)} (assuming it is a cached size), the appropriate
 * {@link AtomicReferenceArray} is searched (starting at the thread-specific {@code location} and iterating forward over
 * it with increments of {@code stepSize}. At each index the cache performs an atomic-swap, retrieving the value
 * at the location and atomically setting that array entry to {@code null}.
 * If a non-null array is found, it is returned and the search terminates (updating the thread-specific {@code location}).
 * If a null element is found, this search repeats {@link #cacheStepLimit} times.
 * If the search fails (or this is an uncached size), a new array is returned.</p>
 *
 * <p>When an array is offered to the cache with {@link #offerArray(byte[])}e), the appropriate
 * {@link AtomicReferenceArray} is searched (starting at the thread-specific {@code location} and iterating backward over
 * it with increments of {@code stepSize}. At each location an atomic compare-and-set (CAS) is used to store the
 * byte array if-and-only-if the current value at that index is {@code null}. This is repeated until it is
 * successfully stored or no open slots are found in {@link #cacheStepLimit} attempts.
 * If no open slots are found, then the offered array is just dropped.</p>
 *
 * <p>The maximum data cached is {@code arrayCacheSize * 512}KB.
 * By default this is 63.5MB</p>
